# Password Generator  

This is a simple random password generator that uses HTML/CSS/Javascript.  The user defines their own rules and then is given a password based on the options they've selected.

I would never use this is for real, this is is just a demonstration.  A far more secure way to make a password generator would be by using the "crypto" function, but that wouldn't allow the user to set their own rules as per the acceptance criteria I was give for this project.
